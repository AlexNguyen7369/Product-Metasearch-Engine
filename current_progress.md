# Current Progress

## Completed
1. 2026-08-18 — Alex Nguyen — Initialized repository with README.
2. 2026-08-19 — Alex Nguyen — Fixed repo structure: `.git` was rooted one
   level up in the parent `Personal-Projects` folder; moved it into
   `Product-Metasearch-Engine/` so this project is a standalone repo like the
   others.
3. 2026-08-19 — Alex Nguyen — Added `stack.md` documenting the chosen tech
   stack (FastAPI, Redis, SerpAPI) and the architectural change required for
   the future MCP server migration.
4. 2026-08-19 — Alex Nguyen — Added `current_progress.md` and a
   `CLAUDE.md` rule to keep it updated after every commit/push.
5. 2026-08-19 — Alex Nguyen — Added `app_structure.md`: planned folder
   layout (`api/` / `services/` / `providers/` / `cache/` / `models/` /
   `core/` / `mcp/`) with reasoning for each split.
6. 2026-08-19 — Alex Nguyen — Scaffolded the full app per `app_structure.md`:
   FastAPI app, `search_products()` service, SerpAPI provider + normalizer,
   Redis cache layer, rate limiting, `Product`/`SearchResponse` models,
   `mcp/tools.py` placeholder, plain HTML/JS frontend, Dockerfile +
   docker-compose. No real SerpAPI key wired up/tested yet — logic only.
7. 2026-08-22 — Alex Nguyen — Added a `/test` placeholder page
   (`frontend/test/index.html`, served via the existing
   `StaticFiles(html=True)` mount) and wired a "Test page" button in the
   frontend to navigate to it; the page itself does nothing yet.
8. 2026-08-27 — Alex Nguyen — Added a front-end scaffold for future
   marketplace features: an inert filters panel (category, price
   min/max, sort) and a disabled pagination bar on the search page,
   wired with IDs/handlers but not connected to `/api/search` yet.

## What's next
**Wire up a real `.env` (SerpAPI key) and run the stack via
`docker-compose up`** to verify the scaffold actually works end-to-end: a
search hits SerpAPI on a cache miss, normalizes results, serves them to the
frontend, and a repeat search is served from Redis instead.

**Why this is next:** everything written so far compiles but has never
actually talked to SerpAPI or Redis. Validating the real request/response
shape now — especially how `google_shopping` really populates `stock`,
`rating`, and `shipping` — will likely surface normalization edge cases
that are cheaper to fix before more features (the filters/sort/pagination
UI just scaffolded, MCP tools) get built on top of `search_service.py`.
